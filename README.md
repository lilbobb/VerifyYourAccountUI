# 🔐 Verify Account UI

This project is a simple and elegant **6-digit email verification UI** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It mimics the user experience of entering a verification code typically sent via email or SMS, commonly seen in account verification and password reset flows.

## 📝 How It Works

1. The UI displays six individual input boxes for a user to enter a code.
2. As the user types, the cursor automatically jumps to the next input.
3. On backspace, the focus moves back to the previous field.
4. Only numbers (0–9) are accepted; other keys are ignored.
5. A message appears at the bottom to clarify this is a demo and no real email is sent.
